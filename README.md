## What is Integration Testing Study?
The "Integration Testing Study" is a further study of unit testing with Mocha and Chai


## What is an integration test?
An **integration test** is a logical extension of *unit testing*, which tests smaller and more independant peices of code. When two or more units 
are combined, they form an *interface*, and when two or more interfaces are combined they form a *component*.

An *integration test* determines if independently developed units work correctly when they are connected to one another.  Integration tests also
